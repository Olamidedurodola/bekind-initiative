# OHW Golden Team

## Project Description
Be kind initiative is birth with that vision of reaching out to the less privileged starting from our small communities. In order to reduce poverty across the world before 2030. We also train youth on leadership and volunteering and ensure our community is free of violence because a hungry man is an angry man.

## Site Objective
It will assist us in reaching out to more persons and help us win some grants that will be useful for our sustainability and operation.
